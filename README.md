Give recommendations on raising the price next year

Recommendations
-	Conservative Increase: Considering the Overall substantial increase (Number of riders, revenue, and profit), a price increase in the range of 10-15% could test the market response without risking a significant loss of customers
-	Price Setting: If the current price is 4.99 USD, a 10% increase would get the price to 5.49 USD, and a 15% increase would get the price to 5.74 USD
-	Market Analysis: Conduct market research to understand Customer satisfaction, competitive changes, and economic environment. This will help lean toward the higher or lower end of the suggested price range.
-	Segmented Pricing Strategy: Consider Different prices for casual versus registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities
-	Monitor and adjust: Implement new price but be ready to adapt and to fine tune based on immediate customer feedback and sales data
